Hello!! Welcome to my little technical corner on the internet.

## Who Am I?

I'm Daniela, a software engineer who's passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. Like many dev, my journey 
in tech has been filled with moments of confusion, breakthrough realizations, and the satisfaction of finally 
getting something to work after hours of debugging.

## Why This Blog?

I started this blog for a few reasons:

**To document my learning journey.** Writing about what I learn helps me understand it and digestive it better. 
If I can explain something clearly, it means I actually get it.

**To share discoveries.** When I find a solution to a tricky problem or learn something interesting, I want to share it. 
Maybe it'll help someone else who's stuck on the same thing I was or that can save some else some time in future.

**To keep it real.** Everything you'll read here is written by me, not AI. In an world full of AI-created content,
creating something with your own thoughts, critical mind and soul takes so much more relevance. 

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Go/Python and systems programming** - Building things from scratch to understand how they work
- **AI/data engineering** - Frameworks, projects, and technologies
- **Learning in public** - Sharing my mistakes and what I learned from them
- **Development experiences** - Real projects, real challenges, real solutions

I won't pretend to be an expert on everything. Many times I'll be writing about things I'm learning'. 
Sometimes I'll be wrong, and that's okay. This is a learning space.

## A Note on Writing

I believe in the value of human-written content. I'm committed to writing my own thoughts in my own words. This means:

- Posts might take longer to come out
- The writing might not be perfect. But it'll be authentic

## Let's Connect

If something I write resonates with you, or if you have thoughts to share, I'd love to hear from you. Learning is better together.

Thanks for stopping by!
