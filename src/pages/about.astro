		Hey! I'm Daniela, a software engineer who loves diving deep into how things work under the hood.
	</p>

	<p>
		My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a genuine love for learning. I'm the kind of
		developer who doesn't just want to use a tool, I want to understand how it's built. That's why I
		enjoy systems programming and building things from scratch. There's something incredibly satisfying
		about understanding the fundamentals.
	</p>

	<p>
		I've worked primarily in java in kotlin, although recently, I'm moving into  Go and Python, currently I'm particularly
		interested in systems programming, AI/data engineering, and backend development. I enjoy the challenge of s
		olving complex problems and the constant learning that comes with software engineering.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is my space to document what I'm learning and share discoveries along the way. I write
		about technical challenges I've faced, projects I'm working on, and concepts I'm exploring.
		Sometimes I'll be writing about things I've just learned, other times about things I'm still
		figuring out. That's the beauty of learning in public.
	</p>


	<p>
		I'm committed to writing authentic, human-created content. Everything on this site is written by
		me, reflecting my own learning journey and perspective. It might not always be perfect, but it'll
		always be real.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you want to connect or discuss something I've written about, feel free to reach out. I believe
		the best learning happens in community.
